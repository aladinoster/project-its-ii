# Project information

## Deliverables {-}

The project is mainly composed in 3 phases.

1. **Problem identification & literature review:** This phases consists in: 

   1. Identify particularly the problem under study, meaning the system to be controlled and the way it is assesed. 

   2. Retrieve bibliographical information about the problem under study. 

   3. Summarize the already proposed alternatives in the existing literature. 

   The main objective of this phase is to understand what are the main challenges when solving the specific project under study and to present in general ways how this problem has been solved. 

2. **Setting up a suitable model:** Once the problem has been identified the main objective is to precisely describe the traffic models that are suitable for the approach. For this phase the stages are divided as: 

   1. Determine a specific traffic model that can be used for the corresponding situation 
   2. Define the scenario in which the solution should be tested 
   3. Pre establish parameters and requirements for the solution to be implemented. 

3. **Experimental results:**  Finally, the main objective is to perform a validation and solution for the problem under study. Several tools are provided for this purpose like micro/macro

## Reporting {-}

In order to fullfill the requirements for each phase each group should provide a report as follows:

- *Report 1:* Summarizes the results of the 1. Problem identification & literature review and 2. Setting up a suitable model. (***Due date: January 9th, 2018***)

* *Report 2:* Summarizes the results of the phase 3.Experimental results (***Due date: January 23rd, 2019***)
